When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

if you are collaborating with others, it is nice to all be able to have access to the repo. Or, when you have a work and home setup with a laptop, it can be nice to have a single place to do all the work from.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Since changes should be logically connected, the programmer needs to determine when changes should be grouped together.
